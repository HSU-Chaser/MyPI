LICENSEE may use the Enterprise Edition Version of the SOFTWARE to develop and run web applications and product(s) that are designed to operate in conjunction with the SOFTWARE.

If the SOFTWARE is to be installed on multiple physical servers (for development, testing, production or other purposes), a separate SOFTWARE license must be acquired for each individual physical server.

This Agreement imposes no restriction on the number of web applications that may be developed or run on a server on which a licensed copy of the Enterprise Edition SOFTWARE is installed, and no limit to the number of end users who may access such web applications.

In such event, LICENSEE must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its component parts. All provisions relating the ownership, disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability and the general provisions shall survive the termination of this License Agreement.

This limited warranty and any implied warranties are effective for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery ("the LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD") as evidenced by a copy of your receipt. GLOBFX warrants to you that when used with the recommended hardware configuration, the SOFTWARE will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation during the LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD. You must report all defects and return the SOFTWARE to the location where you obtained it with a copy of your receipt within such period to be eligible for warranty service.

If the SOFTWARE does not perform substantially in accordance with the documentation during the LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD, the entire and exclusive liability and remedy shall be limited to either, at GLOBFX option, the replacement of the SOFTWARE or the refund of the License fee you paid for the SOFTWARE.
