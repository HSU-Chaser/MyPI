<H2 class="dtH2">What is Swiff Chart Generator?</H2>
<p>Swiff Chart Generator is a web server component that generates 
charts and graphs in Flash or image format from your ASP.NET and ASP pages,
your PHP/JSP/ColdFusion scripts and command line.</p>

<p>Swiff Chart Generator works in conjunction with Swiff Chart, the desktop chart authoring tool 
that enables you to create custom chart templates for use in your server-side scripts.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
    <img src="images/fig.jpg" width=517 height=264>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<H2 class="dtH2">Efficient</H2>

<p>No more static charts and complex
image manipulation or spreadsheet programs: Swiff Chart Generator allows you 
to dynamically create high-impact charts and graphs in Flash or image format. 
Directly from your ASP.NET/ASP/PHP/JSP script, instanciate a new chart object, populate the chart
with custom data values and format the chart with a chart template created with the Swiff Chart desktop editor. 
Once the data are loaded, Swiff Chart Generator
interprets these data and return their representation
as a Adobe Flash&trade; movie or a standard image to be viewed in the Web Browser.</p>

<H2 class="dtH2">Versatile and Flexible</H2>

<p>Swiff Chart Generator works on both Windows and Unix platforms. 
Swiff Chart Generator runs with Internet Information Server
4.0 or higher, Apache Web Server for Windows and Unix and J2EE Web Application Servers
to serve dynamic animated charts and graphs in Flash&trade; right from your server scripts. 
Use PHP, JSP, ColdFusion as well as all the programming languages supported by ASP.NET (and ASP)
, like C# and Visual Basic, 
to access any data source and generate dynamic content for your web site 
application. Swiff Chart Generator can finally be invoked in command line for batch processing.
</p>

<H2 class="dtH2">Powerful</H2>

<p>Swiff Chart Generator is even more powerful when the information you feed it 
are dynamic. You can query data from any database (such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.) 
and submit them to Swiff Chart Generator to instantly generate an eye-catching animated graph. 
This means that you can display up-to-date information all the time. All you need to do is 
manage your database, and Swiff Chart Generator will take care of the rest.</p>
